In order to start running this app, follow these steps:

1) It's a good idea to create a virtual environment for your setup. Open your console or terminal and:
   If you're using Python 3, simply type "python3 -m venv venv" without quotes.
   If you're using Python 2.7 you have to download 3rd party venv here: "https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/". 
   Once downloaded, you can activate venv by typing "virtualenv venv". 
   
2) Activate your venv by typing into console "source venv/bin/activate" and you should have (venv)$ by 
   your cursor in the console.
   
3) Type into your console "'pip install -r requirements.txt'" which will download all needed dependencies.

4) Finally, to fire up this app, type "python app.py" and have fun!
